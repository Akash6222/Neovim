# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration files, heavily customized for my development environment. It is inspired by [Rishabh672003's Neovim setup](https://github.com/Rishabh672003/Neovim), but modified to fit my workflow and preferences.

## Features

- LazyVim plugin management
- Advanced LSP configuration for multiple programming languages
- Custom key mappings for improved efficiency
- Enhanced UI with various Neovim plugins

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akash6222/Neovim.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

2. Install [LazyVim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugin management.

3. Open Neovim and run `:Lazy sync` to install the plugins.

## Usage

- The `lua` folder contains custom settings, including LSP setup, key mappings, and plugin configurations. You can modify these based on your own preferences.
